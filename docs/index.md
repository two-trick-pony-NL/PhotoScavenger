- ⏱ You set a time limit, say 5 minutes 
- 🏃 You try to scan as many objects as you can in the time limit
- 🏆 whoever has the most points at the end of the time wins

### How does the app work, and what data is stored? 
Your picture is sent to a server that has a AI model, that can detect specific objects. The server returns the objects in the picture, and that's how the score gets calculated. 

No user data is stored, no session log is kept. The pictures you take are deleted right after they are processed.
